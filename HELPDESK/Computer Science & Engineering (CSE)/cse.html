                    <p class="heading">I am Amit Kunwar</p>
                    <p> Assistant Professor at CVRU, Vaishali, Bihar. My journey in the field of technology and
                        education has been shaped by years of hard work, learning, and a deep passion for computer
                        science and programming.
                        <br><br>
                        I was born and raised with a curiosity for how things work, especially in the world of computers
                        and software. This interest led me to pursue higher education in engineering. I completed my
                        M.Tech from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University (JNTU), Hyderabad, where I gained a strong
                        foundation in computer science and honed my technical skills.
                        <br><br>

                        After completing my education, I entered the industry, where I accumulated 4 years of valuable
                        experience working on various challenging projects. My work primarily revolved around Hadoop,
                        Java, C++, and Kali Linux. These technologies allowed me to explore the depths of programming,
                        data processing, and cybersecurity, giving me a well-rounded understanding of the tech world.
                        <br><br>

                        After gaining industry experience, I felt a strong desire to share my knowledge and contribute
                        to the academic field. This motivated me to transition into teaching. I have been teaching for 1
                        year now, and it has been a rewarding experience. Guiding students and helping them understand
                        complex concepts brings me immense satisfaction.
                        <br><br>

                        My goal as an educator is to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical
                        application. I believe that my industry experience helps me provide students with real-world
                        insights and practical skills that will help them succeed in their careers.
